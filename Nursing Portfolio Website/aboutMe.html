                    My name is Quang Nguyen and I am currently finishing up my last 2 years of nursing school here at Pacific Lutheran University–on track to graduate with a BSN. From a young age, I seemed to always have questions about many things–but the human body in particular. I found fascination and wonder in the mysterious complexities of our thoughts, metabolic processes, and bodily mechanics. In time, I gained my answers to these questions through biology and chemistry classes in school–but beyond explanations, these classes also revealed to me my own passions for care delivery and the application of science from an altruistic perspective. Sophmore year of highschool, I entered Running Start and began my first steps toward the Nursing career–eventually achieving my AA in pre-nursing at Edmonds Community College at the age of 17. Today, having transitioned into PLU’s nursing program, I look back on my work with great gratitude and accomplishment–but also look forward toward the growth and learning I must do to become the nurse I aspired to be all those years ago.

                    <br />
                    Currently, just having started clinicals, I find great joy and passion in helping our patient populations with ADLs and basic needs. This first round of clinical rotations has given me more hands on experience with delivering holistic care, allowed me to practice theratpeutic communication, and to explore facets of the incredibly wide field that is nursing.

                <h1 id="homeHeading1">Why Nursing?</h1>
                <p>
                     I was born at 26 weeks old where I was greeted by a lesson in how to care by the bright minds and big hearts of the doctors and nurses that gave me a fighting chance at life. With each check-up, ER visit, or asthma attack that followed, I grew closer to them all. From the nurse who took my vitals to the receptionist who would give me a sticker on my way out, every medical professional I encountered made medicine positive and exciting--not just another treatment to complete.<br/><br/>

                    Today, I define medicine as a scientific study applied through an altruistic lens. Science functions widely to answer our largest questions--which were never in short supply to my young mind. I wanted to learn how everything worked. Why did it get hard to breathe if I had asthma? What does it mean if you have diabetes? Why do we get sick?<br/><br/>

                    In time, I gained my answers one by one, book by book, and class by class. Biology showed me the fascinating world that existed around me, on me, and inside of me. Chemistry humbled me by putting the complexities of existence into an atomic perspective. Science made me appreciate life and my ability to live it.<br/><br/>

                    To become a nurse is to show my value for life by giving others a fighting chance to enjoy it another day. To be a nurse is to say thank you to those that allowed me to survive to dream of working among them. To be a nurse is to care--or to put it simply: to demonstrate my own humanity. Simply put, a patient is more than just their ailments.
